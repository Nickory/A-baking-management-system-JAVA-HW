# A-baking-management-system-JAVA-HW

This is a **Baking Management System** project developed as part of my Data Structure and Algorithms coursework in 2023. The system is implemented in Java and demonstrates fundamental concepts in data structures and algorithms through a baking management simulation.

## 📋 Project Overview

The Baking Management System provides a simulated environment to manage various baking-related tasks. It includes features for:
- Managing and storing information about different baked items
- Organizing ingredients and recipes
- Tracking baking schedules and orders

This project is intended as a hands-on exercise in Java programming, focusing on implementing and using data structures to manage and manipulate information efficiently.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Ingredient Management**: Add, remove, and update ingredients.
- **Recipe Handling**: Create and manage recipes with specific ingredients.
- **Order Processing**: Track orders and baking schedules.
- **Data Persistence**: Save and load system data to enable continued use.

## 🧑‍💻 Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a text editor for running Java files

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nickory/A-baking-management-system-JAVA-HW.git
